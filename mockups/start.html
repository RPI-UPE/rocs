  <h4 align="center">The Rensselaer Open Course Scheduler</h4>
  <p>
    The Rensselaer Open Course Scheduler was developed as a replacement to the RPI Scheduler by Upsilon Pi Epsilon, the international honor society for the computing and information disciplines. The new scheduler is tied to your RCS account through the RPI Portal and uses information provided by the Registrar as part of an initiative to change how you plan your studies and schedule courses. Eventually, ROCS will be tied into the Banner system underlying SIS, providing a direct mechanism for registering your courses for the coming semester.
